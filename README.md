Neotest
=======

An alternative sandbox game to Minetest Game

Objectives
----------

I have multiple objectives with this game, 
first it is primarily about programming a voxel sandbox that is actually fun to explore with as little complicated code as there can be, i try to keep this game both simple and engaging

Things that need to be known
----------------------------

* I guarantee no compatibility with mods written against `default` or that use any other components of Minetest Game, this is an independent game, not a Minetest Game Redo.
* This is an early alpha, don't worry, this project will go somewhere but right now, it doesn't have support for most things you might expect
* Sounds won't be in this game right now, neither will be localization. Those features will be added at a later date
